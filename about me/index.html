     <p>Hi everyone! My name is Blayke Peapealalo and I'm interested in pursuing a degree in Web and Computer programming. On my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, being outdoors, watching tv, running, shopping and sleeping.</p>
    <p> I'm 19 so definitely not married. Taking this course, I think, would be super useful for the future. I'm hoping to find a career in the programming or web field because they interest me the most. I also would love to work remotely and travel the world while I'm still young! 
    </p>I've been a member all my life and I'm so grateful for this gospel and this school! Here's a scripture from my most recent reading! Isaiah 30:18. Hope you enjoy!</p>
     </p>
